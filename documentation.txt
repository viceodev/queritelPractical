The Required Project was built with HTML, SCSS(CSS Preprocessor) and JavaScript.

I implemented the UI with HTML and SCSS which is CSS Preprocessor that makes writing styles faster and easier.

I implemented the functionalities of the maps and Api request with JavaScript.

I employed the use of modules to make sure my code is structured.

For the JavaScript Modules, here is the list and what the files do.

1. Google Maps Module: 
    Path: './js/Modules/google_maps.js'
    Function:  The instantiates google maps on the page.

2. Utilities Module:
    Path: './js/Modules/Utils.js'
    Function: This file handles the Menu functionalities which calls a required Function in the Request Module based off the 'data-target' attribute on the menu list anchor tag.

3. Request Module:
    Path: './js/Modules/Request.js',
    Function: This file contains the following functionalities
        1. The base url for making http request
        2. The functions for calling the right api when events are fired from the Utilities Module. These functions also calls the DOM Handler to handle the data gotten from the api.

4. Dom Handler: 
    Path: './js/Modules/dom_handler.js'
    Function: This module contains functions that takes in response from whatever function that called it and then render it to the DOM.

5. Map Hanlder:
    Path: './js/Modules/map_handler.js'
    Function: This module is proposed to contain the functions that handles the displays for the map.
